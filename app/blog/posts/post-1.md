# My First Blog Post

This is my first blog post. I'm excited to start writing about my thoughts and experiences.

In this post, I'll talk about how I created this blog.

I used Next.js with TypeScript and Markdown files. It was pretty easy to set up. I just followed the instructions in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

I'm also using gray-matter to read the metadata from the Markdown files. This allows me to get the title, date, and description of each post.

I'm using react-markdown to render the Markdown content into HTML. This makes it easy to display the blog posts on my website.

I'm also using react-syntax-highlighter to highlight the code blocks in the Markdown content. This makes it easier for readers to understand the code.

I'm still learning about Next.js and Markdown, but I'm excited to keep writing and learning.
